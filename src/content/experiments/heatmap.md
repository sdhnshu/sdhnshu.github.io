Usage analysis of real-estate using CCTV footage.

### What is it?
This project was an attempt to understand the space utilization from a co-working standpoint. To find out what parts of the furniture were being used according to the time of day, I ran analyses on the CCTV footage.

By doing a simple comparison of 5fps to an image without people, I found the amount of "usage". The image you see above is after plotting the "usage" as a heatmap. It resulted from analysis of a 3 hour footage.

### Why?
Understanding space utilization can help decision making and improve the quality of interactions within an area.
