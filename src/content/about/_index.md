![about](/img/about.png)

I'm Sudhanshu. I am a Backend Engineer who helps startups build great products so they can create an impact on the market. Currently based out of Bengaluru, India.

Welcome to my website! Here you will find writeups about projects I work on, things that inspire me, and any other thing that catches my attention.

I spend most of my days designing software & writing code that runs on servers. Often my work extends to your screen, like this website. I fell in love with computers at a very young age and it grows everyday. For those who live on the cutting edge, I've co-authored a book called '[PyTorch Deep Learning Hands-on](https://www.packtpub.com/product/pytorch-deep-learning-hands-on/9781788834131)' that you can buy from Packt Publishing. I also love generative art & create my own when I have time.

To collaborate, you can reach out to me via email at sudhanshupassi@gmail.com. I reply within a day or two. You can also send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sdhnshu/). Although I use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sudhanshupassi) just to follow industry folks, I may get back there soon too.

I built this site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and modified its [Creative Portfolio](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme/) theme to fit my style. I'm hosting it using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free. If you want to use this as a template, feel free to fork it on [Github.](https://github.com/sdhnshu/sdhnshu.github.io)
