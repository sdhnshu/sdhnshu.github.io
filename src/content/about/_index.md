![about](/img/about.png)

I'm `Sudhanshu`. I am a `Backend Software Engineer` who helps startups build a _scalable tech foundation_ for their _crazy ideas_. Welcome to my website! I write about the `technology` & `art` projects I work on. You will also find lists of links that I've collected around a certain topic I'm currently captivated by.

I am based out of `Bengaluru` & spent my childhood in a small town near `Mumbai`. I'm an `audiophile` at heart & love to play my guitar. I love Generative Art, which brings together my passion for code & `visual arts`.

Shameless plug for my book: ['PyTorch Deep Learning Hands-on.'](https://www.packtpub.com/product/pytorch-deep-learning-hands-on/9781788834131)

__Do Reach Out__ to me if you want to collaborate on any project. I would love to create something exceptional & unique for you. Email is my primary contact `sudhanshupassi@gmail.com`, although you can also reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sdhnshu/) or [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/Sudhanshupassi)
