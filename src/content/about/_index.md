### About this website

The primary purpose of this website is to serve as a [showcase](/showcase) of my accomplishments. But, I also use it as my personal corner on the web. Here, I keep track of my [experiments](/experiments) with code and [inspirations](/inspirations) from across the web.

I built this site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and modified its [creative portfolio theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme/). [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) host this website for free.

### About me

![about](/img/about.png)

Hi! Iâ€™m Sudhanshu. I have 2.5+ years of experience building software interfaces and analytics pipelines. I love visual arts and am most expressive with computer-generated art. Considered a graphic design career but had better skills with computers.

I love working with startups and small-mid size companies. With my experience, I helped [Locale.ai](https://www.locale.ai/) bootstrap their geo-spatial data analytics platform. At [CoWrks](https://www.cowrks.com/), I helped power core revenue streams by building software services. Their clients still use the social network I helped build to connect. In my latest project, I give artists control over an AI to generate new realistic images. It uses the [StyleGAN2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04958) neural network under the hood.

I am fluent in Python and can work with any library it supports. I have built systems with relational, document, graph, and cache databases. I have routed messages using queues and exchanges, automated repetitive tasks, and used cloud services. The [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) authorization service I created, used an [asynchronous server](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). I load tested, documented, and managed logs for it. I have also worked with C, C++, Java, Javascript, R, and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). For creative work, I work with Photoshop, Illustrator, [Processing](https://processing.org/), [p5js](https://p5js.org/) and [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/).

My love for computers began when I encountered my first at age 7. And I loved it for two reasons. One, because I could play games at home. Two, because it didn't make any human errors. The emotional catharsis after [killing Hitler](https://youtu.be/bVU3o8tCE8o?t=797) in Wolfenstein 3D was the result.

Outside of computers, my love flows towards nature and its inner workings. I appreciate it by studying its physics, tinkering with everything I get. Recently, I've found love in biological aspects of nature, like genetics and evolution. These things reflect in my thinking process and my creations.

One of my earliest inspirations is Leonardo Da Vinci. And being a polymath, he inspired a lot of things in me. Thanks to him, I started sketching, keeping a notebook, and [mirror writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_writing#Notable_examples). Also, I started appreciating [mathematics in nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterns_in_nature) and the workings of the human brain.
