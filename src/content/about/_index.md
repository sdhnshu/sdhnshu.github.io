![about](/img/about.png)

I'm Sudhanshu. I am a Backend Engineer who helps startups build great products so they can create an impact on the market.

Welcome to my website! Here you will find writeups about projects I work on, things that inspire me, and any other topic that interests me.

I'm currently based out of Bengaluru, India, and spend my days designing software & writing code. I'm also an audiophile by heart and am learning to play the guitar. Recently I fell in love with Generative Art, which brings together my passion for code and visual arts. I've also co-authored a book called ['PyTorch Deep Learning Hands-on.'](https://www.packtpub.com/product/pytorch-deep-learning-hands-on/9781788834131)

Do reach out to me if you want to collaborate on any project. I would love to create something exceptional and unique for you. Email is my primary contact `sudhanshupassi@gmail.com`, although you can also reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sdhnshu/) or [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/Sudhanshupassi)
