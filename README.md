The primary purpose of this website is to serve as a [showcase](https://sdhnshu.github.io/showcase) of my accomplishments. But, I also use it as my personal corner on the web. Here, I keep track of my [experiments](https://sdhnshu.github.io/experiments) with code and [inspirations](https://sdhnshu.github.io/inspirations) from across the web.

I built this site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and modified its [creative portfolio theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme/). [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) host this website for free.


## Development commands
- `hugo new inspirations/test.md` to create a new blank post
- `hugo server -D` to run locally and build drafts
- `./build.sh` to build from the src directory and output to root dir
